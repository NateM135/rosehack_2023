The application in question is a tool designed to assist women in finding employment opportunities in specific areas within their country. The application utilizes demographic data specific to the user's country to provide targeted job suggestions and resources.

The application begins by prompting the user to select their country of residence. Once selected, the user is presented with a variety of demographic data specific to their country, including information on population, education levels, and employment rates. This data serves as a foundation for the application's job suggestion algorithm, which utilizes data-driven insights to identify potential job opportunities that align with the user's demographics and location.

Users can also join cohorts lead by curated leaders from nearby locations. These users can interact and recieve advice from a cohort through a portal within the application.

Overall, this application aims to empower women to take control of their career paths by providing them with the resources and information they need to identify and pursue job opportunities availble in their geograhic area.
