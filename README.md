Across the globe, women have a lower labor force participation rate compared to men due to less access to economic resources, spending a substantial amount of time on unpaid care work and domestic labor, and cultural forces tying them to familial duties. 

Working Women is an online training, job-matching, and coaching program that aims to increase employment for young women. This program provides girls aged 16-27 with life skills, training, and job placement assistance. The application is a tool designed to assist women in finding employment opportunities in specific areas within their country. The application utilizes demographic data specific to the user's country to provide targeted job suggestions and resources.

The application begins by prompting the user to select their country of residence. Once selected, the user is presented with a variety of demographic data specific to their country, including information on population, education levels, and employment rates. This data serves as a foundation for the application's job suggestion algorithm, which utilizes data-driven insights to identify potential job opportunities that align with the user's demographics and location.

Users can also join cohorts led by curated leaders from nearby locations. These users can interact and receive advice from a cohort through a portal within the application.

Overall, this application aims to empower women to take control of their career paths by providing them with the resources and information they need to identify and pursue job opportunities available in their geographical area. Girls and young women develop valuable employable skills, and employers gain an experienced, skilled talent pool trained with in-demand skills.

Working Women benefits girls by training them with employable skills tailored to their location, and benefits companies by providing a capable and diverse workforce. Many organizations already offer some type of gender parity program, but we aim to streamline this process by connecting with employers in the region to find in-demand skills in industries. This will lead to a more sustainable program due to its mutual beneficiaries. In addition, there is an alumni association so that after girls “graduate” into the workforce, they can return to mentor as cohort leaders and help employ more girls into their company or industry. These programs allow our program to be self-sustaining.

## Data

The data was obtained from the National Bureau of Statistics of China, 2019 Statistical Yearbook. Screenshots captured from this statistical yearbook was then processed by an online Optical Character Recognition software and the data was then exported into an excel spreadsheet. The data was then further broken down into various combinations of years, region, and industries to show different trends in the data. 

These smaller tables were then visualized using Tableau bar graphs and other visualization methods.
